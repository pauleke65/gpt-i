AI/ML Core: Develop an AI/ML module that can effectively read and understand the content of incoming emails.\n2. Networking & Communication: Implement functionality to automatically send responses to the sender of the email. The response content should be based on the understanding of the AI/ML module.\n3. Notification: As part of the automated process, generate notifications for the customer support representative whenever the AI module decides a human response is needed, or whenever the system gets a complex query email.\n4. Analytics and Reporting: Collect and analyze data on the number of automatically answered emails, the number of emails requiring human interference, efficiency of the AI/ML module, etc. This data can be used to measure and improve the system over time.\n\nAfter each development step, a corresponding set of tests should be performed to ensure the functionality of each module.", "sequence_diagram": "sequenceDiagram \nUser->>AI/ML: Pass incoming email for understanding \nAI/ML-->>User: Determines if it can respond \nNote right of AI/ML: If it can answer,\nAI/ML->> Networking & Communication: Pass response to email sender\nNetworking & Communication-->>User: Notify that response sent \nNote right of AI/ML: If it cannot answer,\nAI/ML->>Notification: Indicate human response is needed \nNotification-->>User: Alert of task \nUser->>Analytics: Log actions \nAnalytics->>User: Provide data for reports", "milestones": [{"milestone": "Develop AI/ML Core", "tasks": [{"name": "Design AI/ML architecture", "description": "Design an optimal AI learning model that fits the requirement of understanding emails content"}, {"name": "Implement AI/ML architecture", "description": "Code the AI/ML module based on designed architecture"}, {"name": "Test AI/ML Core", "description": "Test the AI/ML core module with various sample emails content to ensure it works correctly"}]}, {"milestone": "Develop Networking and Communication", "tasks": [{"name": "Create automatic response system", "description": "Build a system that uses the outputs of AI/ML Core to automatically send replies to email senders"}, {"name": "Integrate email communication", "description": "Incorporate the ability for the system to send and receive emails"}, {"name": "Test Network and Communication", "description": "Ensure the response and email communication systems work correctly and reliably"}]}, {"milestone": "Develop Notification System", "tasks": [{"name": "Build notification system", "description": "Design a system that will trigger notifications based on AI/ML core outputs"}, {"name": "Integrate notification with AI/ML Core", "description": "Link the notification system with AI/ML Core to receive necessary triggers"}, {"name": "Test Notification system", "description": "Test scenarios to ensure notification system triggers correctly"}]}, {"milestone": "Develop Analytics and Reporting", "tasks": [{"name": "Design analytics and reporting system", "description": "Create a means to record and assess data related to automatic replies, human interactions, and AI/ML efficiency"}, {"name": "Implement analytics and reporting system", "description": "Build the analytics system according to the design and integrate with the rest of the modules"}, {"name": "Test analytics and reporting system", "description": "Ensure the analytics and reporting systems record data accurately and generate correct reports"}]}]}, {"story": "As a sales and marketing manager, I want to automate emailing prospects and tracking responses so that I can improve my conversion rate", "goal": "Increase sales and marketing efficiency", "modules": ["AI/ML Core", "Networking & Communication", "Analytics and Reporting", "Promotions"], "workflow": "1.
