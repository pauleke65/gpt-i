AI/ML Core: Develop an AI/ML module that can effectively read and understand the content of incoming emails.\n2. Networking & Communication: Implement functionality to automatically send responses to the sender of the email. The response content should be based on the understanding of the AI/ML module.\n3. Notification: As part of the automated process, generate notifications for the customer support representative whenever the AI module decides a human response is needed, or whenever the system gets a complex query email.\n4. Analytics and Reporting: Collect and analyze data on the number of automatically answered emails, the number of emails requiring human interference, efficiency of the AI/ML module, etc. This data can be used to measure and improve the system over time.\n\nAfter each development step, a corresponding set of tests should be performed to ensure the functionality of each module.", "sequence_diagram": "sequenceDiagram \nUser->>AI/ML: Pass incoming email for understanding \nAI/ML-->>User: Determines if it can respond \nNote right of AI/ML: If it can answer,\nAI/ML->> Networking & Communication: Pass response to email sender\nNetworking & Communication-->>User: Notify that response sent \nNote right of AI/ML: If it cannot answer,\nAI/ML->>Notification: Indicate human response is needed \nNotification-->>User: Alert of task \nUser->>Analytics: Log actions \nAnalytics->>User: Provide data for reports"}, {"story": "As a sales and marketing manager, I want to automate emailing prospects and tracking responses so that I can improve my conversion rate", "goal": "Increase sales and marketing efficiency", "modules": ["AI/ML Core", "Networking & Communication", "Analytics and Reporting", "Promotions"], "workflow": "1.
